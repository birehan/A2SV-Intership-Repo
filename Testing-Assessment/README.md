# Testing Assessment

## Errors found
- The error in the  to_lower function: in the line that converts uppercase letters to lowercase letters. The line should subtract 32 from the ASCII code of the uppercase letter to get the ASCII code of the corresponding lowercase letter.
- The error in the  capitalize function: The  if result: statement should be if string: instead. This is because  result is an empty string at the beginning of the function, so the if result: statement will always evaluate to False .

## Done test on the file string_functions.py
