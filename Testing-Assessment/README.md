# Testing Assessment

This README file contains the instructions you should follow to successfully complete the Testing Assessment.

In this github repository, you’ll find 3 python files: string_functions.py, example_test.py, and 
Test.py. 

String_functions.py contains the code and logic for which you’ll be writing tests. 
Example_test.py shows you what a sample answer looks like. Study the code to understand how to use python’s unittest library to test python code.
Test.py is where you’ll be writing your code. 

Your goal is to write an exhaustive clean test code that ensures string_functinos.py is adequately tested.

Instructions 
1. Clone the repository containing the files. You don’t need to create any branches as you’ll be working on the main branch of the repository you cloned.
2. Edit Test.py to include testing for methods in the string_functions.py file. Make sure to cover everything you’ve learnt to write a robust test for the functions. Don’f forget to comment on your code and follow good naming conventions. 
3. When you’re done, commit your changes. Your last commit before the deadline will be considered as your final solution.

Good luck!
